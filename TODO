TODO LIST!

- SESSIONS:
--- add "log in" button (and "log out") -- in footer?

- DATABASE:
--- FUTURE: make version-of-post immutable...
--- FUTURE: make styling (.css file, bootstrap theme?) user-configurable, in the db, somehow

- CONTENT:
--- on /post/:id page, show timestamp
--- make article view better: permalink, title=link?, etc.
--- add RSS, and link to it in <head>

- SIDEBAR:
--- make search box actually make an ajax call, and put results in a list below it
--- next to each post, show the timestamp (created? updated?).  (as relative, but click/tap to toggle absolute?)
--- FUTURE: different icon for "created"/"updated" entries
----- and a way to toggle between them?

- HEADER/FOOTER:
--- make "about" light up, when it's the page you're looking at
--- MAYBE?: fix footer, so it doesn't float when you scroll down?

- EDITOR:
--- add markdown editor

- MISC:
--- FUTURE: pick a better font for everything?
--- automatic affiliate links, for amazon?
--- a "forgot password" feature?  i can have the email address, but then i need to send email...
--- a link to the github page?  (better: put it in an HTML comment.)
--- add import/export -- this can double as an easy backup system
