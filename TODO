TODO LIST!  visuals only, for starters:

- NAVBAR:
--- get rid of "home" tab
--- get rid of "contact" tab -- everything ABOUT the blog goes on the "about" page
--- add shadows for header/footer
--- MAYBE?: make footer color go all the way to the bottom?
--- pick better colors!

- CONTENT:
--- make article view better: permalink, title=link, no "full article->"?, etc.

- DATABASE:
--- have it connect to a database, and do "select 1;" on page-load.
--- make a 'blogs' table, with one record (id, title, author_name, author_email, colors/styles, etc.)
--- make a 'posts' table, with (id, blog_id, content, created, updated)  [FOR NOW: edit in-place]
--- make a 'docs' table, with (id, slug(?), name, content)  [FOR NOW: just (id, 'about', 'About', ...)]

- SIDEBAR:
--- FUTURE/MAYBE?: make the search box smaller?
--- FUTURE: different icon for "created"/"updated" entries
----- and a way to toggle between them?

- MISC:
--- FUTURE: pick a better font for everything?
--- automatic affiliate links, for amazon?
