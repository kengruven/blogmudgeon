TODO!

- SESSIONS: let me log in/out!
--- [ ] change /secret into /home, which calls view-home, and has functionality for change-password, etc.
--- [ ] when logged in, show different stuff than before:
----- left sidebar, with controls?
----- next to "log out" link, show name, too
----- "new post", etc.
--- [ ] FUTURE?: on /login, also have a "forgot password?" link, which sends email with a reset link.
--- [ ] FUTURE: a "change password" link?
--- [ ] FUTURE: figure out SSL...
--- [ ] FUTURE: on failed password, focus password field first?
--- [ ] FUTURE: make log-in page into a dialog box


- SEARCH
--- [ ] STYLING: make :h5 small-caps, and un-indent lists completely.  (Q: how do i know when one line-wrapping item ends, then?)
--- [ ] handle failure of the ajax call -- put an error notice here?  (Q: should the server generate this?  it's easiest there, but the client has to deal with the error condition of the server going dead, anyway.)
----- just chain a .fail() call, and have it change the [:h5] to "Error during search"
--- [.] make the ajax query show /images/spinner.svg on start_search()
--- [ ] add a proper db index
--- [?] FUTURE: pagination?  if i'm only displaying 5, that could be nice -- if i have only a few posts.
--- [ ] animate showing/hiding of results box (?)
--- [ ] FUTURE/DESIGN: are blog titles too long for the sidebar?  should it expand into a full normal page of search results?  hmm...
--- [ ] FUTURE/DESIGN: does it need a search button?  can it search as you type?
--- [ ] put search term in search results box, somehow (e.g., "No results for 'foo'")
--- [ ] FUTURE: put total count in results title, too?  (e.g., "Results 1-5 of 52")

- DATABASE:
--- FUTURE: make version-of-post immutable...
--- FUTURE: make styling (.css file, bootstrap theme?) user-configurable, in the db, somehow

- CONTENT:
--- on /post/:id page, show timestamp
--- make article view better: permalink, title=link?, etc.

- SIDEBAR:
--- next to each post, show the timestamp (created? updated?).  (as relative, but click/tap to toggle absolute?)
--- FUTURE: different icon for "created"/"updated" entries
----- and a way to toggle between them?

- HEADER/FOOTER:
--- make "about" light up, when it's the page you're looking at
--- MAYBE?: fix footer, so it doesn't float when you scroll down?

- EDITOR:
--- add markdown editor

- MISC:
--- make blog title (top left of header) highlight on hover, too.  it's weird that it doesn't.
--- FUTURE: pick a better font for everything?
--- automatic affiliate links, for amazon?
--- a "forgot password" feature?  i can have the email address, but then i need to send email...
--- a link to the github page?  (better: put it in an HTML comment.)
--- add import/export -- this can double as an easy backup system
--- Q: my sample japanese text isn't searched at all -- is there an easy fix?
